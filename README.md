# ðŸ§  Simple Neural Network from Scratch (NumPy)

This project is a small but complete implementation of a **neural network built entirely from scratch** using only NumPy (and matplotlib for plotting).  
It predicts a continuous value based on a tiny sample dataset and helps demonstrate how a neural network learns step by step.

## ðŸ“Œ What this project shows

- How to initialize weights and biases
- Perform a **forward pass** to make predictions
- Use an **activation function** (ReLU) to introduce non-linearity
- Calculate the **loss** (Mean Squared Error)
- Compute gradients in the **backward pass**
- **Update weights** to reduce the loss over time
- Save predictions to a CSV file
- Plot predicted vs actual values to visualize learning

## ðŸ›  How to run

1. Clone this repository or download the code.
2. Make sure you have Python installed, along with NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
